## Purpose and Goal
This is a tracking tool based off of Ninja One statistics. It's designed to parse data and display useful and detailed analytics along with automated reports to assist with data gathering and analysis. The goal of this project is to make a proof of concept that shows such custom software would be useful and eventual implementation of much more in depth features.

## Design
The design is heavily limited due to a lack of accessibility to the Ninja One API, however with that in mind there are two primary parts of the program. Firstly, the "CSV Parser Mode" is essentially a CSV parser with Ninja One directly in mind for analyzing statistics. The "API Access" mode is currently unimplemented due to the reasons stated prior, however in the future if this proof on concept proves to be valuable, implementing it could be beneficial.

## Tools Used
This program is being developed using Visual Studio 2022. As of 2/14/2025 I am on the latest version, however I keep my client updated so this will vary throughout time. The program is being developed using C# and Winforms on the .net framework.

## Current State
Currently, the code base and general application is quite primitive. However, due to using Winforms, robust construction of the application is much quicker than normal. The current major focus with the basic application and functionality being completed is fully implementing and displaying useful data within the "Ticket Analytics" tab within the program. With strong enough data analytics I believe this will bring a good proof of concept with time.
